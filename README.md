# musikcube → Discord Rich Presence

Show the track you're currently playing in [musikcube](https://github.com/clangen/musikcube)
as **Discord Rich Presence** ("Listening to …"), with artist, album and a live
progress bar.

musikcube has no built-in Discord plugin
([feature request #431](https://github.com/clangen/musikcube/issues/431)), so this
is a small bridge: it reads the now-playing track from musikcube's built-in
WebSocket metadata server and pushes it to Discord over the local Discord IPC
socket. No data leaves your machine.

```
musikcube  ──WebSocket(7905)──▶  bridge.js  ──Discord IPC──▶  Discord
```

## Requirements

- [musikcube](https://github.com/clangen/musikcube) with its **WebSocket server
  enabled** (default port `7905`; on by default).
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) 18+.
- The **Discord desktop app** running (Rich Presence does not work in the
  browser).

## Setup

### 1. Install

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ediiloupatty/musikcube-discord-rpc.git
cd musikcube-discord-rpc
npm install
```

### 2. Create a Discord application (gives you a Client ID)

1. Open <https://discord.com/developers/applications> and log in.
2. **New Application** → name it `musikcube` (this name shows in your status) →
   **Create**.
3. On **General Information**, copy the **Application ID** (= Client ID).
4. *(Optional, for cover art)* **Rich Presence → Art Assets** → upload an image
   named exactly `musikcube` (and optionally `play` / `pause`). Asset processing
   can take a few minutes.

### 3. Configure

```sh
cp config.example.json config.json
```

Edit `config.json` and set `discordClientId`. Adjust `musikcubePath` if musikcube
isn't at `C:\musikcube\musikcube.exe`. If you set a server password in musikcube,
put it in `musikcube.password`.

### 4. Discord privacy setting

Discord → **Settings → Activity Privacy → "Share your detected activities with
others"** must be **ON**.

## Usage

```sh
npm start
```

Play a song in musikcube — it appears in your Discord profile within a second,
and updates on track change / pause / stop.

`node test-musikcube.js` prints the current track without touching Discord (handy
for debugging).

## Windows: start automatically with musikcube

This repo includes a launcher that starts the bridge when you open musikcube and
stops it when you close musikcube:

- `launch-musikcube.ps1` — launcher logic (auto-detects Node, reads
  `musikcubePath` from config, watches the musikcube process).
- `Musikcube (with Discord).vbs` — runs the launcher hidden (no console window).

Create a shortcut to the `.vbs` (target `wscript.exe "…\Musikcube (with
Discord).vbs"`) and use it instead of your normal musikcube shortcut. To start at
login, drop that shortcut into the `shell:startup` folder.

`start.bat` is also provided to run the bridge alone in a visible window.

## Configuration reference

| Key | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `discordClientId` | Discord application (client) ID. **Required.** |
| `musikcubePath` | Path to `musikcube.exe` (used by the Windows launcher). |
| `musikcube.host` / `.port` | musikcube WebSocket server address (default `127.0.0.1:7905`). |
| `musikcube.password` | musikcube server password, if you set one. |
| `musikcube.pollSeconds` | How often to refresh the now-playing track (default `2`). |
| `presence.largeImageKey` | Art asset key uploaded in the Discord portal. |
| `presence.largeImageText` | Tooltip text for the large image. |
| `presence.showTimestamp` | Show the elapsed/remaining progress bar. |

## How it works

The bridge authenticates to musikcube's WebSocket server and polls
`get_playback_overview` every couple of seconds (musikcube doesn't reliably push
broadcasts to every client). Updates are deduped on track identity, so Discord is
only touched when the track or play state actually changes — the progress bar
keeps ticking on its own from the timestamp set once per track. Each change is
mapped to a Discord activity (type *Listening*) via
[`@xhayper/discord-rpc`](https://github.com/xhayper/discord-rpc). See the
[musikcube remote API docs](https://github.com/clangen/musikcube/wiki/remote-api-documentation).

## Cross-platform note

The bridge itself (`bridge.js`) is platform-independent and works on
Windows/macOS/Linux. Only the `.ps1`/`.vbs` auto-launch helpers are
Windows-specific; on other systems just run `npm start`.
